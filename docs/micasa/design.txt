Mi Casa Design -*- mode: outline -*-

* Overview

The Mi Casa service is a combination of a game server and a client
framework for hosting relatively simple, networked, multiplayer games. The
service is designed for hosting games implemented using the Parlor
services and built on top of the Cocktail networking platform.

The Mi Casa service is comprised of a server that can be configured to
have any number of lobbies in which users can get together to play games.
