MiCasa Design -*- mode: outline -*-

* Overview
The MiCasa service is a combination of a game server and a client
framework for hosting relatively simple, networked, multiplayer games. The
service is designed for hosting games implemented using the Parlor
services and built on top of the Presents networking platform.

The MiCasa service is comprised of a server that can be configured to have
any number of lobbies in which users can get together to play games.

* Notes
Maybe move lobby stuff into parlor.

Move lobby configuration (which lobbies to load) into database. Make it so
that lobbies can be created/destroyed on the fly.

Sort out a different way for lobbies to get configuration information than
being passed a properties file that was extracted from the server
configuration. We'll want inheritance and all that.
