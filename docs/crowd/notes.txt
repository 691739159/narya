* TODO
Wire up PlaceRegistry code to remove registrations when place objects are
destroyed.

Flesh out the mechanism for passing config information to place managers.
Make it easy to build an inheriting chain of configuration properties.

Occupant info needs to be stored in place objects. We could create special
list distributed object fields that can store homogenous lists of objects
that implement some sort of serializable interface. Once this is done,
it'll have to be wired up on the server side so that extended occupant
info can be easily provided and on the client side so that that info can
be passed around the client.
