** Scene tagging
- Create a mechanism whereby scenes can be annotated with tags or somesuch
  which are available without resolving the scenes.

** Portal tagging
- During the scene resolution process, tag portals that connect a scene to
  its neighbors in a named direction (north, east, south, west) as scene
  graph defining portals (and different from portals that link a scene to
  some internal sub-group like the entrance to an inn or a link to the set
  of rooms upstairs)
