Narya Notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Media framework
Make sure the animation and sprite stuff is general purpose.

Fix all the code that presently loads up tiles from tilesets by id which
should really be loading the tilesets by path.

* General
Remove dependencies of nodemap on miso.

Perhaps provide an application identifier to the resource manager so that
it can cache resource sets in a unique directory in the event that
multiple Narya using applications are run on the same machine.
