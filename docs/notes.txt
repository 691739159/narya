Narya Notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Media framework
Make sure the animation and sprite stuff is general purpose.

Fix all the code that presently loads up tiles from tilesets by id which
should really be loading the tilesets by path.

* General
Remove dependencies of nodemap on miso.

Perhaps provide an application identifier to the resource manager so that
it can cache resource sets in a unique directory in the event that
multiple Narya using applications are run on the same machine.

Make Object{Input|Output}Stream which manages mapping from Streamable
class to two-byte identifier wherein the class name is only transmitted
the first time the class is seen on the stream and is subsequently
identified by the two-byte identifier. The client and server can use these
streams on either end to efficiently transport serializables. They will
need to be reset when the client loses connection. Check to see if
Serializable support already does this (in which case we can just use it
directly).
