Required external libraries
---------------------------

The Narya code requires the following external Java libraries (JAR
files) to be placed (or symlinked) here in the lib/ directory or in the
shared library directory specified in the build.xml file
(${java.libraries}).

* The samskivert package:
  (check out from CVS: projects/samskivert)

* MM MySQL driver:
  http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/

* Matt Welsh's Non-blocking IO library:
  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/java-nbio/

  (The native code shared library should be built and placed into
  lib/i686-Linux where it will be automatically added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  by the runjava script. Alternatively you can put it into your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH by hand.)

* The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.1 Reference Implementation:
  http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html

  (Only crimson.jar and jaxp.jar are required.  xalan.jar may safely
  be excluded.)

* Megginson Technologies' XMLWriter 0.2 library:
  http://www.megginson.com/Software/xml-writer-0.2.zip

Once the jar files are in place (regardless of what they are named), the
build system will automatically include them in the compile-time
classpath.
